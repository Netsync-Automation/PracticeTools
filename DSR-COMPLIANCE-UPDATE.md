# DSR Compliance Update for Resource Assignments

## Overview
Updated resource assignments to be DSR (Do Shit Right) compliant by ensuring all user fields store both names and emails for proper Webex notifications and email generation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`lib/dynamodb.js`)

#### `addAssignment` Function
- **Added email processing**: Now looks up user emails from the users table when creating assignments
- **New fields stored**:
  - `am_email`: Account Manager email address
  - `resource_assigned_email`: Resource Assigned email address
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging for user email processing
- **Server-side only**: Email lookup only occurs server-side to avoid client-side database calls

#### `formatAssignmentItem` Function
- **Added new email fields** to the returned assignment object:
  - `am_email`
  - `resource_assigned_email`

#### `updateAssignment` Function
- **Dynamic email updates**: When user names are changed, automatically looks up and updates corresponding email addresses
- **Maintains consistency**: Ensures name and email fields stay synchronized
- **Enhanced logging**: Tracks when user emails are updated during assignment modifications

### 2. API Route Updates (`app/api/assignments/route.js`)

#### POST Route (Create Assignment)
- **Added notification users parsing**: Properly handles JSON notification users data
- **Enhanced parameter passing**: Now passes all required parameters including:
  - `documentationLink`
  - `pmEmail`
  - `notificationUsers`

### 3. DSR Compliance Verification

#### Test Coverage (`test-dsr-compliance.js`)
- **Comprehensive testing**: Verifies all user fields store both names and emails
- **Update testing**: Ensures email synchronization works during updates
- **Compliance scoring**: Provides percentage-based compliance assessment
- **Cleanup**: Properly cleans up test data

## DSR Compliance Status

### ‚úÖ BEFORE (SA Assignments)
SA assignments were already DSR compliant:
- `am` + `am_email`
- `isr` + `isr_email` 
- `saAssigned` (stores "Name <email>" format)
- `submitted_by_email`

### ‚úÖ AFTER (Resource Assignments)
Resource assignments are now DSR compliant:
- `am` + `am_email`
- `pm` + `pm_email`
- `resourceAssigned` + `resource_assigned_email`
- `resource_assignment_notification_users` (stores name + email objects)

## Benefits

### 1. Webex Notifications
- **Reliable delivery**: All notifications can now use email addresses for accurate user identification
- **Consistent user mapping**: No more failed notifications due to missing email addresses

### 2. Email Generation
- **Complete recipient lists**: All email notifications have access to both names and email addresses
- **Professional formatting**: Can use "Name <email>" format in email headers
- **Improved deliverability**: Proper email addressing reduces bounce rates

### 3. System Reliability
- **Data consistency**: Names and emails are automatically synchronized
- **Future-proof**: New assignments automatically include all required fields
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing assignments continue to work while new ones are enhanced

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Processing
- Email lookup only occurs on the server to maintain security
- Uses existing user database for email resolution
- Graceful fallback when users are not found

### Database Fields
```javascript
// New fields added to assignments table
{
  am_email: { S: 'account.manager@company.com' },
  resource_assigned_email: { S: 'resource@company.com' },
  // Existing fields maintained
  pm_email: { S: 'project.manager@company.com' },
  resource_assignment_notification_users: { S: '[{"name":"User","email":"user@company.com"}]' }
}
```

### API Integration
- Existing API calls continue to work unchanged
- New email fields are automatically populated
- Frontend components receive enhanced data structure

## Testing Results

```
üìà DSR Compliance Score: 7/7 (100%)
‚úÖ FULLY COMPLIANT: All user fields store both names and emails
‚úÖ Resource assignments are now DSR compliant for Webex notifications and email generation
üèÅ Test completed: PASSED
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Assignments
- **No migration required**: Existing assignments continue to work
- **Gradual enhancement**: Email fields will be populated when assignments are updated
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality remains intact

### New Assignments
- **Automatic compliance**: All new assignments are automatically DSR compliant
- **Enhanced notifications**: Immediate benefit from improved email and Webex integration
- **Complete data**: All user fields include both names and emails from creation

## Conclusion

Resource assignments are now fully DSR compliant, matching the standard set by SA assignments. This ensures reliable Webex notifications and email generation across the entire Practice Tools system.
