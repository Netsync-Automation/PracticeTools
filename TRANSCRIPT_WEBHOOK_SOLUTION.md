# Transcript Webhook Issue - Root Cause & Solution

## Root Cause Identified ✅

**Transcription is not enabled for Webex meetings**, which is why:
- Recording webhooks work perfectly ✅
- Transcript webhooks are configured correctly ✅  
- No transcript webhooks are received ❌ (no transcripts generated)
- Manual API calls find 0 transcripts for all meetings ❌

## Immediate Solution Steps

### 1. Enable Transcription in Webex Settings

**For Meeting Hosts:**
1. Go to Webex Settings → Preferences → Recording
2. Enable "Automatic transcription" 
3. Ensure transcription is enabled for all future meetings

**For Webex Site Admin:**
1. Go to Webex Control Hub → Services → Meeting
2. Navigate to Site Settings → Common Settings → Recording
3. Enable "Transcription" site-wide
4. Set default transcription language

### 2. Test with New Meeting

1. Schedule a new meeting with transcription enabled
2. Record a meeting longer than 5 minutes with clear speech
3. End the meeting and wait for processing
4. Monitor webhook logs for transcript events

### 3. Verify Webhook Scopes

Ensure the Webex integration has these scopes:
- `meeting:recordings_read` ✅
- `meeting:transcripts_read` ✅  
- `meeting:admin_transcripts_read` ✅
- `spark:recordings_read` ✅

## Technical Implementation Status

### Current Webhook Implementation ✅

The webhook code is correctly implemented:

```javascript
// Handles transcript webhooks properly
if (resource === 'meetingTranscripts' && event === 'created') {
  await processTranscript(data.id, data);
}
```

### Webhook Configuration ✅

Both webhooks are active and properly configured:
- **Recordings Webhook**: Active, receiving events ✅
- **Transcripts Webhook**: Active, waiting for events ✅

### Missing Component ❌

**Webex transcription is disabled**, so no transcript webhooks are generated.

## Verification Steps

After enabling transcription:

1. **Test Meeting**: Create a 5+ minute meeting with clear speech
2. **Check Logs**: Monitor for transcript webhook events
3. **Verify Processing**: Confirm transcripts are downloaded and stored
4. **Database Update**: Ensure meeting records are updated with transcripts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Meeting ends → Recording webhook received → Meeting stored without transcript
2. Transcript processing completes → Transcript webhook received → Meeting updated with transcript
3. Both recording and transcript data available in database

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check for transcript webhook events
node check-transcript-logs.js

# Monitor all webhook activity  
node check-webhook-logs.js

# Test transcript availability
node test-transcript-webhook-direct.js
```

## DSR Compliance ✅

This solution follows DSR principles:
- Uses existing webhook infrastructure
- Maintains separation of concerns (recording vs transcript processing)
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- No duplicate functionality created
